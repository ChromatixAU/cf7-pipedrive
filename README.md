# CF7 - Pipedrive Integration Plugin

This is a fork of: [CF7 Pipedrive Deal on Submit](). It is a minimal plugin that creates a Pipedrive Deal using the form information when a Contact form 7 form is successfully submitted. Enter your API key and the forms you want Deals submitted for and you're done.

## Installation

1. Download the zip file and extract the contents. Upload the 'cf7-pipedrive' folder to your plugins directory (wp-content/plugins/).
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.  
3. Go to Settings -> CF7 Pipedrive and set your Pipedrive API and select the Contact Form 7 Forms you want to submit a Deal.
4. That's it!

## Usage

Once the above installation is complete, ensure your contact form has at least Name, Email and Phone form fields, as these are required to make a deal occur.
